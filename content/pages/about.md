Hello world! This is usually how I start my websites.

Anyway, let's keep this quick and simple, my name is Gabriele Musco, as you can probably tell by the name of the website, and I'm a developer.

I got my University degree in **Computer Science** on the 26th of July 2019, and I'm currently studying for my master's degree.

I am the developer of some free software applications for the Linux desktop, namely:

- [Feeds](https://gfeeds.gabmus.org)
- [HydraPaper](https://hydrapaper.gabmus.org)
- [What IP](https://whatip.gabmus.org)
- [Notorious](https://notorious.gabmus.org)
- [Giara](https://giara.gabmus.org)

I also have a YouTube channel called [Tech Pills](https://techpills.technology) where I talk about tech, Linux and other related stuff I like.

This blog is about me and what I'm working on, and what I feel like talking about.
