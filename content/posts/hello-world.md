## My new web home

Hey people. I finally got around at creating a static blog.

After using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a while, and initially deciding to try out [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), just to realize it's in a sad, outdated state right now, I settled on [Hexo](https://hexo.io).

It's not like I'm crazy for JavaScript, quite the contrary. But I do realize it has its place sometimes. Using `npm` to install plugins is pretty clever, and besides at the end of the day I am the only one that has to use it.

It has a more complex structure compared to the aforementioned solutions, but if it gets the job done I can't complain too much.

## Recap

This is an interesting point in my life. In July I got my bachelor's in Computer Science, it was a pretty great achievement, and soon I'll be heading to Milan to get a master degree.

About my projects, things are going very well. I am focusing a lot on GTK/GNOME apps, probably because I'm making things I want to use in the first place.

[HydraPaper](https://gabmus.gitlab.io/HydraPaper) got a pretty substantial update, introducing [libhandy](https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy) into the mix to spice up its looks somehow, and mostly to make use of some comodity widgets it offers, namely the awesome `HdyPreferencesWindow`.

For the thesis of my bachelor's, I presented another interesting app called [Unifydmin](https://gitlab.com/GabMus/unifydmin). It's a control center and administration panel for servers. It's a very interesting project, but it's still quite rough around the edges. I have to find the motivation to pick it up again, but right now I'm focused on another project.

And this project is [Feeds](https://gabmus.gitlab.io/gnome-feeds), a feed reader. It may sound dumb, but I couldn't find a single feed reader app for linux that I liked. Everything is either old, slow or electron based. After some time complaining about this (my girlfriend and friends can tell you about it), and basically using reddit and the podcasts I follow to get the latest news, I said F it, and made my own thing. It's going pretty well and the people that tried it seem to like it, and that makes me actually very proud of it.

And I think that's about it for now. I hope I manage to get my S together and start blogging more frequently, because I quite enjoy being able to share dev stuff online.

Let's see where that goes.
