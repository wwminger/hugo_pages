[Feeds version 0.7 should be out soon](https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.gabmus.gnome-feeds) with all the features detailed in [this post](/2019/08/20/Feeds-saving-articles-offline-and-marking-stuff-as-read/).

The code starts to feel a little more complex, and it would probably use another small refactoring, but that's not too important right now.

Let's lay out a new roadmap, with the features I implemented, and some new ones I want to add:

- [x] ~~Read and unread articles~~
- [ ] Keeping history of older articles locally (still not sure if I actually want this or not)
- [ ] Adblocking
- [x] ~~Saving articles~~
- [ ] Suggestions
- [ ] Integration with GNOME Online Accounts
- [ ] [Integration with TTRSS](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GabMus/gnome-feeds/issues/4)
- [ ] Ability to open rss links and OPML files
- [ ] *Offline mode* with a banner indicating that the system is offline

There's still some work to do. Of course any help is welcome and appreciated.
